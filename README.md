**Guides, prevention tips, and poetic scrolls from the *Everyday Soul: Tips & Tricks* series — crafted to help you defend, recover, and navigate digital storms with clarity and courage.**

## ✨ About This Repository

From the creative mind of **Helen Najar | Lionheart**, this collection transforms each episode of the *Everyday Soul: Tips & Tricks* series into written “scrolls.”
Each guide blends **technical steps**, **faith-driven wisdom**, and **practical recovery paths** for everyday digital users — teaching not just how to react, but how to stay prepared.

> it simply reminds you how precious the helm truly is.”
