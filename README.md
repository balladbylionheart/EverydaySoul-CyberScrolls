## ✨ About This Repository

From the creative mind of **Helen Najar | Lionheart**, this collection transforms each episode of the *Everyday Soul: Tips & Tricks* series into written “scrolls.”
Each guide blends **technical steps**, **faith-driven wisdom**, and **practical recovery paths** for everyday digital users — teaching not just how to react, but how to stay prepared.

> it simply reminds you how precious the helm truly is.”
