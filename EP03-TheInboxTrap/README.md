### 🎬 Summary
Your inbox may look calm — but beneath the surface, traps are set.  
This scroll uncovers how **phishing and spoofing** forge trust, mimic legitimacy, and steal familiarity to make you click before you think.  
Learn how to recognize the bait, identify spoofed emails, and anchor yourself in wisdom before the storm.

---

### ⚔️ The Lesson
- **Phishing** lures you with bait — false urgency, emotional hooks, or tempting rewards.  
- **Spoofing** forges identities, mimicking trusted senders or even *you* to bypass suspicion.  
- **Red flags:**  
  - “From” address mismatches (sender ≠ domain)  
  - Emotional triggers like *final notice*, *account closure*, *unclaimed deposit*  
  - URLs with misspellings, odd endings, or unexpected redirects  
- **Rule:** Pause before you click. The wiser sailor checks the waters before raising the sail.

> “It’s not just a scam — it’s a mirror.  
> Twisted to make you click before you question.”

### 🌅 Reflection
Wisdom sails above the storm.  
Awareness is your anchor — even in chaos, you can stay afloat.  
Pause. Breathe. Look again before you trust what glitters.
