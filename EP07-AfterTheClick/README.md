### ⚔️ The Five Steps  

1. **Close the page.**  
   Let the screen go dark — don’t press another key.  

2. **Cut the signal.**  
   Turn off Wi-Fi or unplug the cable. Drop the sails of connection.  

3. **Change your passwords.**  
   Use a trusted device (your phone or another computer).  
   Start with your main email, then banks and online stores.  

4. **Run a full scan.**  
   Open your antivirus (like Microsoft Defender) and choose **Full Scan**.  
   Let it search every corner and remove what it finds.  

5. **Keep watch.**  
   Check your messages and accounts over the next few days.  
   If gold moves that you didn’t spend, call your bank right away.

### 🌅 Reflection  
> “A wrong click doesn’t end the voyage —  
> it just reminds you how precious the helm truly is.”  

Stay calm. Respond, don’t panic.  
Every sailor learns the sea by surviving the storms.
