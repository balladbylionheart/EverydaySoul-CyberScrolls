## 🎬 Summary

Your network is your harbor — the quiet shoreline where most storms begin.
This scroll teaches how to secure the dock itself: your Wi-Fi, your router, and the forgotten gates attackers quietly test.

## ⚔️ Core Lessons

* **Change Defaults**
  Your Wi-Fi name and admin password should never remain factory-set.
* **Hide What You Can**
  SSID hiding isn’t perfect, but friction slows intruders.
* **Disable Unused Features**

  * **WPS** → an unlocked gate
  * **Remote management** → close it
  * **Guest networks** → turn off when not needed
* **Firmware Updates**
  Your reinforced planks — patching old cracks.
* **Watch Who Connects**
  Unknown devices mean unknown risks. Treat them like drifting ships in restricted waters.

### 🌅 Reflection

“Harbors look peaceful…
but peace comes from vigilance, not chance.
Secure the dock, and the storms lose their teeth.”
