# ⚙️ EP05 – Follow the False Trail: Scan the Link Before You Sink  

### 🎬 Summary  
You’ve received a suspicious email.  
It looks familiar—maybe even urgent. But not every trail is meant to be followed.  

This scroll from the *Everyday Soul: Tips & Tricks* series teaches how to **scan a suspicious link safely** before clicking, using **VirusTotal** and similar online engines.

### ⚔️ Lesson Focus  
1. **Recognize fake sender patterns** (email domain mismatches, urgency cues).  
2. **Learn to copy and scan URLs** using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) and similar scanners.  
3. **Interpret red vs green engine results** — understanding how to read “phishing” or “malware” verdicts.  
4. **Develop calm, proactive habits** when faced with suspicious links.  

> “Every trail has a truth beneath the surface.  
> Don’t sink — scan first, and sail safely through the digital wild waters.”

### 🌅 Reflection  
Even a single moment of caution can prevent a cascade of regret.  
When in doubt — pause, copy, scan, *and then decide.*  

Every act of awareness is a firewall in disguise.
