### 🎬 Summary  
One red flag might pass as a gust of wind — but when the sea turns crimson, it’s no longer a warning. It’s a verdict.  
In this episode, we journey through the world of **verdict engines** — Bitdefender, Fortinet, VirusTotal, and others — to uncover how they interpret danger and how to listen when multiple voices call out “phishing.”  

It’s not just about scanning. It’s about **decoding**.  
Learning to hear when one engine whispers and when many cry out — *fire on the deck.*  

---

### ⚔️ The Lesson  
Each verdict engine has its specialty.  
Some hunt phishing, others track malware.  
Together, they create a compass — a system of collective sight.  

When one engine warns you, pause.  
When five engines agree, *turn the ship.*  
A clean verdict isn’t luck — it’s earned through clarity, testing, and trust.  

- Learn how to interpret security engine verdicts  
- Recognize the difference between “false alarm” and “digital fire”  
- Understand why consensus across engines means truth worth heeding  

> “Don’t guess. Read the table. The engines don’t cry out for no reason.”

### 🌅 Reflection  
> “Their verdict is earned — etched in breach reports and stolen keys.  
> If they warn you, it’s not just a guess. It’s a compass.”  

Sail with discernment.  
Because wisdom is not in silence — it’s in knowing when to turn before the tide does.
