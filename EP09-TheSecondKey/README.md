## 🎬 Summary

A password is a key — but one key was never meant to stand alone.

This episode introduces **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** as the second lock that guards your digital gates.  
It explains *why passwords fail*, *how MFA works*, and *how to choose a simple, reliable authenticator without overwhelm.*

This scroll is about **discipline, not fear** — one habit that quietly keeps the harbor secure.

## ⚔️ Core Lessons

- Passwords can be stolen, guessed, or leaked.
- MFA adds a **second decision point** — a pause that proves identity.
- You don’t need many apps — just **one you trust**.
- Authenticator apps protect accounts even when passwords are compromised.
- Simplicity beats complexity when security becomes habit.

## 🌅 Reflection

> *“One key opens the door.  
> The second decides who walks through.”*

Security isn’t panic — it’s preparation.  
The strongest gates are quiet, consistent, and intentional.
