### 🎬 Summary  
Where logic meets flame, even maintenance becomes mindful.  
This scroll explores **Disk Cleanup** — a simple, overlooked tool that restores order and space without risk.  
You’ll learn what’s safe to delete, what to keep, and how to approach every cleanup with intention, not haste.

> “Even a simple cleanup deserves intention.  
> Let your system breathe, but don’t strip it of its safety net.”

### ⚔️ The Lesson  

#### 1. Open Disk Cleanup  
- Press **Windows + S** → type **Disk Cleanup**, then open the app.  
- Or **Right-click → Run as Administrator** for a deeper scan.  
- Select the drive you wish to clean (usually C:).  

#### 2. Review What Can Be Deleted  
Disk Cleanup will list file types such as:  
- **Temporary files**  
- **Thumbnails**  
- **Recycle Bin contents**  
- **Downloaded program files**  

It’s safe to remove these regularly.  

#### 3. Know What to Keep (Cautious List)  
- **System Restore Points** – Backups that save you when something breaks.  
- **Shadow Copies** – Older file versions that can restore lost work.  
- **ESD Files** – Critical for resetting or reinstalling Windows.  

If you’re low on space and have backups, you may remove them — but proceed thoughtfully.

#### 4. Intentional Maintenance  
- Don’t rush; read each label before selecting.  
- You’re not just cleaning files; you’re caring for your system’s memory.

### 🌅 Reflection  
A system, like a soul, doesn’t thrive on emptiness — it thrives on balance.  
Keep what protects you, release what weighs you down.
