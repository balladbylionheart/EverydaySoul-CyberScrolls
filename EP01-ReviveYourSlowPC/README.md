### 🎬 Summary  
Your machine — like you — holds memories, burdens, and tired circuits.  
This opening scroll teaches you how to **restore performance and breathe life back into your PC** through simple, safe cleanup steps.  

Learn how to use Task Manager, disable heavy startup apps, and clear temp files — all without breaking a thing.  

> “Sometimes it’s not about being broken — just a little too full.  
> Clear the clutter. Let the circuit breathe.”

### ⚔️ The Lesson  

1. **Open Task Manager**  
   - Press **Ctrl + Shift + Esc**.  
   - Sort by **CPU** or **Memory** to find what’s slowing you down.  

2. **Disable Startup Apps**  
   - Click the **Startup Apps** tab.  
   - Right-click unnecessary items → **Disable**.  
   - *Do not disable Microsoft Defender or your antivirus.*  

3. **Clean Temporary Files**  
   - Press **Windows + R**, type `%temp%`, press **Enter**.  
   - Press **Ctrl + A** to select all, then **Delete** or **Shift + Delete** to remove.  
   - Skip files that show “in use.” They’ll vanish later automatically.  

4. **Why It Works**  
   - You’re not deleting vital system files.  
   - You’re removing leftover cache and logs that slow startup and memory.

### 🌅 Reflection  
A slow system isn’t failure — it’s fatigue.  
Sometimes, healing isn’t repair; it’s release.  
Clear what you no longer need and make room for what’s next.
