### 🎬 Summary
Spotting the lie is only the first step.  
This scroll teaches you how to **unmask suspicious senders** using **MXToolbox**—your free lantern in the fog.  
You’ll learn to check MX records, verify SPF and DMARC, and read a domain’s email health so you can see past the mask.

### ⚔️ The Lesson
- **MX (Mail Exchange) records:** Show which servers are authorized to receive mail for a domain.  
- **SPF (Sender Policy Framework):** The guest list—tells the internet which hosts can send mail for the domain.  
- **DMARC (with DKIM/SPF alignment):** The enforcer—what to do if mail fails the checks (monitor, quarantine, or reject).  
- **Email Health checks:** Surface errors, missing records, and misconfigurations—the “skeleton of a scam.”

> “A sender’s name can wear a smile while setting a trap.  
> Now you have vision. Tools. Truth.”

### 🌅 Reflection
You don’t need to guess.
